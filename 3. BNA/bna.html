        <h2> Brief History</h2>
        <p>
          Nashville International Airport first opened in June 1937 and named Berry Field in honor of Colonel Harry S. Berry. Colonel Berry was the state administrator of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), who were responsible for the construction. When first built, Berry Field consisted of a terminal building, two hangers, a 4,000 feet concrete runway and a flashing beacon on top of a 340-acre site located along what is now Murfreesboro Road. The airport’s three letter identifier, BNA, stands for Berry Field NAshville.

          During World War II, the airport became the military base for the 4th Ferrying Command, which saw the airport increase in size to 1,500 acres. The rapid growth of air transportation during the 1950s and 1960s led to the creation of a new terminal and crosswind runway, along with an expansion to the existing runway. By 1977,  Berry Field had increased to 3,300 acres with 3 runways and a renovated terminal. Yet, the expansion of the airport continued during the 1980s, with the opening of JWN airport for small planes and the addition of a new terminal. In 1988, the airport's name, Berry Field, was replaced by Nashville International Airport.

          Nashville International Airport had other major terminal renovations in 2012, the same year that marked the 75th anniversary of the airport's opening. As of 2015, over 11 million passengers travel through the airport. The airport has daily arriving and departing flights to other parts of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, and more recently England.

        <h2>Climatological Data Station
        </h2>
        <p>
          Since January 1st, 1948, Nashville International Airport has served as a station for climatological data collection for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The station has been collecting data on different meteorological parameters including the temperature and precipitation, when it was available.

        <h3>Increase in Extreme Weather</h3>
        <p>
          Although it is not possible to create a clear picture of the change in the weather over the past 21 years from the data at the BNA station due to lack of data, it is still possible to have an idea of what the weather will be like in Nashville in the future through third party research. Nevertheless, the trendlines for the average maximum, average, and minimum temperatures all appear to have increased over the 21 year expansion (Figure 1). It is difficult to assess exactly how climate change may be affecting the weather and meteorological events, but it is still possible to predict some of those climate events (1).  For instance, the increase in temperature, like the ones observed in the trendlines in Figure 1, could increase the probability of more hot days and nights. This increase in temperature could also increase the chances of more extreme droughts and increase rainfall. The latter may be supported by the increase in droughts In Georgia between the 1980’s and the 2010’s, although the study was not able to determine if climate change had any effect (2). Even though there are no studies with similar observations in Tennessee, it is still possible that the similar events have occured in TN as its climate is not so different from that of Georgia.  However, study did find that in comparison to 1957-1983, Central Tennessee in 1984-2013 had the largest increase in tornado days (not total tornado days)  with 29 days, the greatest increase in winter tornadoes with 56, and the greatest increase in spring tornadoes with 105 (3). That same study also found that there was an increase of significant (big or notable) winter tornadoes across Tennessee, and an increase of autumn tornadoes in Western Tennessee. Yet, they were also not able to connect their findings to effects of climate change.

        <h3>
          Introduction or Increase of diseases</h3>
        <p>
          Furthermore, this increase in temperatures in Nashville and in Tennessee could introduce new diseases as the ranges of their carriers, like mosquitos, increase. One study looking at the monthly data for Salmonella outbreaks in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama  between the years 2002 to 2011 found that there is a strong positive correlation between high temperatures and outbreaks of Salmonella (3). They also noticed an apparent strong effect of the increase in temperature and the increase of Salmonella outbreaks, and in which an increase of 1°F seemed to result in 4 infections, or an increase of 3% of the average infection as of 2014.

          Yet, more serious problems would occur with the introduction or increase of vector-borne diseases. For instance, study models that account for future climate scenarios under climate change suggest that Nashville, TN could possibly see 50% of cases of Dengue fever during the summer as San Juan, Puerto Rico: a place known for having Dengue fever year round (4). Degue of one of the mosquitoes-borne diseases, but if mosquitos are able to infect humans with dengue in the future, they would also be able to infect humans with other diseases like malaria and zika. Still, even while malaria or mosquito-borne are able to infect humans, it is unlikely that they would cause outbreaks (4-5). Additionally, there could also be an introduction of Chagas disease in Nashville and the rest of Tennessee due to climate change making conditions more suitable for the survival and spreading of the disease. Chagas disease accounts for 45,000 deaths and 10 million worldwide every year, and which spreads through insects  like wheel bugs, ambush bush and kissing bugs.
